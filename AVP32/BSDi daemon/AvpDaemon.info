Command Line Options
====================

   Available command line options are the following:

`-dk'
     Kill a running gpm. This can be used by busmouse users to kill gpm
     before running X (unless they use -R or the single-open limitation
     is removed from the kernel).

`-dv'
     Print version information and exit.

`-dh'
     Print a summary of command line options.

`-dd FILENAME'
     Choose the directory for AvpDaemon control files. It defaults to `/var/run'.

`-dm'
     Enable multiple mode. The daemon will read two different mouse
     devices.  Any subsequent option will refer to the second device,
     while any preceding option will be used for the first device. This
     option automatically forces the "repeater" (-R) option on.

`-dq'
     Quit after changing AvpDaemon behaviour. This is intended to allow
     users to change the AvpDaemon parameters (as ...)
     without restarting the server. Since this needs root permissions,
     the system administrators can use the `set-uid' bits to
     enable/disable such capability. Changing parameters is
     nonetheless only allowed from one of the virtual consoles. Options
     are transferred only for the first AvpDaemon.

//`-i INTERVAL'
//     Set INTERVAL to be used as an upper time limit for multiple
//     clicks. If the interval between button-up and button-down events
//     is less than LIMIT, the press is considered a double or triple
//     click. Time is in milliseconds.
