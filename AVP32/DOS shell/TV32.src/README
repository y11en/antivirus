		TVision for DOS, OS/2, DOS32 (Level D)

WHAT IS THIS?
-------------

	This is a TurboVision v1.03 (originally by Borland International)
	bugfixed & ported to:
		
	Operating system		Compiler
	================		=====================
	MS DOS				Borland C++ v3.1
	MS DOS 32 bit (DOS4GW)		Watcom C++ v10.0
	OS/2				Borland C++ v1.5 for OS/2
	OS/2				Watcom C++ v10.0
	WIN NT (and Win'95)		Borland C++ v5.01
	WIN NT (and Win'95)		Watcom C++ v10.0

	All known bugs of TVision are fixed.

   news for level A:
	Long file names under OS/2 are supported now.
	Mouse handler bug is fixed (Tvision works with PMODE/W now).
	Several bugs are fixed.

   news for level B:
	Bug in TEditor::nextWord()
	OS/2: keys Ctrl-S,Ctrl-Q,Ctrl-P etc are recognized now
	OS/2: Alt-Space is recognized now
	DOS32: Alt-Space,Shift/Ctrl-Ins/Del...
	TProgram::getPalette: added help palette
	OS/2: setmode/getmode functions work now
	OS/2: setCursorType/getCursorType functions work now

   news for level C:
	Fixed bug in new.cpp: 4 bytes for each character was allocated.
	OS/2: now TVision can be run without a mouse
	Fixed a bug in tlstview.cpp: short lines were incorrectly displayed
		if indentation was bigger that line length.
	The following 2 bugs were found by Harry Nikolayev (2:5020/75):
	OS/2: screen was garbled on some adapters when switching from
	full-screen TVision application to PM and back.
	fpstream: removed ios::out so that resource files can be opened
	for read only.

   news for level D:
	applied new patches from J”rn Sierwald
	OS/2 & NT: a new variable in TProgram:
	    static int near event_delay;// time to wait for an event
    					// in milliseconds. default: 200
					// the idle() function may change
					// this value to lower values
					// and it will be called more frequently
	    int set_event_delay(int delay);	// returns old value
	    int get_event_delay(void);
	OS/2: keyboard and mouse thread run at time critical priority
	32bit: selection highlight in TEditor worked incorrectly.
		(thanks to Sergey Bogdanov, 2:5100/26.106)
	Win32 version is supported now (Windows NT and Windows 95).
	  it can be compiled with watcom v10.0 or bcc v5.01
	NO_TV_STREAMS removes streams support from TV. Look at .CFG files.
	Mouse evMouseAuto event is generated properly under OS/2

    TODO:
   	!!! VIO.. structures must be relocated to 'tiled' structure !!!

WHAT YOU NEED TO COMPILE IT
---------------------------

	- MAKE.EXE from BORLAND (for OS/2 or for MS DOS or for Win32)
	  I don't use WMAKE.EXE
	- BCC C++ or Watcom C++ (evidently)

INSTALLATION AND COMPILATION GUIDE
----------------------------------

	TVision was simply copied from the IDA directory,
	so you'll have to modify some files to compile it.

	Please read this file completely!

  IMPORTANT NOTE:
  	If you don't have make.exe from Borland and want to compile
	TVision manually, don't forget that you should define a some
	macros to define the target platform. Please read this file and
	look at *.CFG files for macro names.

0. Unpack the archive _tvos3d.zip into any directory with -d switch:

	d:
	md \idasrc
	cd \idasrc
	pkunzip -d _tvos3d.zip

1. Inspect and modify the following files:

	allmake.mak	- the main make configuration file
	dosbor.cfg	- switches for BCC C++ v3.1 compiler
	os2bor.cfg	- switches for BCC C++ for OS/2 v1.5
	w32bor.cfg	- switches for BCC C++ v5.01 target WIN NT
	os2wat.cfg	- switches for Watcom C++ v10.0 target OS/2
	d32wat.cfg	- switches for Watcom C++ v10.0 target DOS4GW
	w32wat.cfg	- switches for Watcom C++ v10.0 target WIN NT

   In these files there are directory names, don't forget to modify them.

   Of course, you are free to use other compilation switches too.

2. Set the environment variable IDA to the root directory of the original
   archive _tvos3.zip, for example:

   	set IDA=d:\idasrc\

   Don't forget the trailing backslash.

3. How to compile it? I prepared .BAT & .CMD files to compile
   the library. To compile manually, in the tvision\source directory enter:

	Target OS			Command
	---------			-------
	MS DOS      			 - make
	OS/2 using Borland		 - make
	OS/2 using Watcom		 - make -D__WATCOMC__ -U__MSDOS__
	WIN NT using Watcom		 - make -D__WATCOMC__ -D__NT__
	WIN NT using Borland		 - make               -D__NT__
	MS DOS 32 bit			 - make -D__WATCOMC__ -D__MSDOS__

   To get libraries for MS DOS 16 bit, you need to run make under MS DOS.
   For other libraries, use OS/2 or MS DOS (or Windows).

4. Object files will be stored into:

	tvision\source		- MS DOS obj files
	tvision\source\bor.os2	- OS/2 BCC obj files
	tvision\source\wat.os2	- OS/2 Watcom obj files
	tvision\source\wat.w32	- WIN NT Watcom obj files
	tvision\source\bor.w32	- WIN NT Borland obj files
	tvision\source\wat.d32	- MS DOS 32 bit obj files

   Libraries:

	tvision\lib		- MS DOS libraries
	tvision\libbor.os2	- OS/2 BCC libraries
	tvision\libwat.os2	- OS/2 Watcom libraries
	tvision\libwat.w32	- WIN NT Watcom libraries
	tvision\libbor.w32	- WIN NT Borland libraries
	tvision\libwat.d32	- MS DOS 32 bit libraries

   There will be 2 libraries for each system:

   	tv.lib    - overlayable library
   	tvasm.lib - non-overlayable library

   Obviously, overlays are meaningful only for 16 bit MS DOS, I create
   2 libraries only for compatibility of makefiles.

   TLIB.EXE or WLIB.EXE are never called directly from the makefile,
   a special utility called AR.EXE is called instead to create libraries.
   This utility provides a unique interface (similar to unix ar command)
   and creates a zero-length flag file which is used by makefile.
   This utility is in /bin and /bin/os2 directories.

5. About compilation time variables:

	__MSDOS__	should be defined for MSDOS
	__OS2__		should be defined for OS/2
	__NT__		should be defined for WIN NT
	__DOS16__	should be defined for MSDOS 16 bit
	__DOS32__	should be defined for MSDOS 32 bit
	__BORLANDC__	should be defined for Borland compiler
	__WATCOMC__	should be defined for Watcom compiler
	__NOROW__	this var disables a special processing
			for screens with >25 rows. Honestly,
			I don't clearly understand why TVision
			does this processing.
	NO_TV_STREAMS	removes streams support from TVision.

   The allmake.mak, makefile and *.cfg files automatically
   define them, just don't delete these definitions.

ADDITONAL NOTES (PLEASE READ THEM TOO!)
---------------------------------------

1. Allocate enough stack space when linking executables for DOS4GW.
   I lost about a week trying to understand why HELLO.EXE program
   (included in the package) causes a trap. 8k stack is enough, I recommend
   at least 16k.

2. There is no error handling code for OS/2 and NT. It is not nesessary,
   though.

3. TVision doesn't give up timeslices under MSDOS - you have to
   do it yourself in your application, in the idle() for example.

4. Build and run HELLO.EXE for each library created. There is
   a special target 'hello' in the makefile.

5. Any feedback is appreciated. E-mail address is at the end of the file.

6. Ctrl-Break is not handled under OS/2. You need to set up your own SIGINT
   signal handler. Also, some quirk needed in handling Ctrl-Break under DOS32:
   you need to call _bios_keybrd(_KEYBRD_READ) when you clear ctrlBreakHit.
   Here is an example:

#ifdef __DOS32__
    if ( TSystemError::ctrlBreakHit == Boolean(1) )
      _bios_keybrd(_KEYBRD_READ);
#endif
    TSystemError::ctrlBreakHit = False;

  You need it because otherwise a call

	_bios_keybrd(_KEYBRD_READY)

  will always return 0, even if the user continues to press keys
  and your program (well, it keyboard) will hang.
  I don't know the reason, most likely it is a bug in _bios_keybrd().
  This behaviour is present in Watcom 10.0b
